# 🚀 Very Advanced Hello World in Python

A playful demonstration of advanced Python features all wrapped up into printing the classic **"Hello, World!"** message.

This script uses modern Python concepts like **asynchronous programming**, **decorators**, and **metaclasses** to showcase how complex and powerful Python can be — even for something as simple as saying hello.

---

## 🔍 Features

- Uses **async/await** to handle asynchronous code execution
- Implements a **decorator** to log function calls asynchronously
- Employs a **metaclass** to dynamically inject methods into a class
- Simulates asynchronous delays with `asyncio.sleep`
- Combines multiple advanced concepts in a single, compact example

---

## 💻 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher (required for `asyncio.run`)

### Installation

No external libraries needed — this uses Python's standard library.

### Running the Script

Simply run:

```bash
python advanced_hello_world.py
You should see log messages indicating the function calls followed by the classic:

Edit
Hello, World!
🧠 How It Works
The HelloMeta metaclass injects an asynchronous say_hello method into the HelloWorld class.

The greet method is decorated with async_logger which logs before and after the greeting asynchronously.

The main async function creates an instance of HelloWorld and calls greet.

asyncio.run(main()) starts the async event loop and runs the program.

🎯 Why?
This project is designed for Python enthusiasts and learners who want to explore advanced language features in a fun and approachable way.
